# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is an app that allows people to keep track of their appointments by using colour coding to indicate timing and urgency.
red for current time, grey for the past and green for upcoming appointments
Each is designated with a save key and it's written to local storage for future refresh.
Time is shown above the appointments and is referenced to change the colour values of each time slot.

## Visuals
Please see the files in the assets folder.

## Usage
Opening the web page will open the app.  Clicking on the text area will allow the adding of the text for the appointment. Clicking save will store the value for future refresh.
Note it will remain day to day as there is no clear function for a new day.

## Support and references
My tutor helped me locate a class that wasn't loaded correctly but overall I came up with the methodology on my own.  Was a lot of code.  There are console.logs all over to help me check that values were working and that things were loading.  This was a very challenging challenge.
This app uses Day.js to function out the time.
